"""
Once you've written the bitcoinToUSD function, use it to calculate the value of your Bitcoin in USD,
and then create an if statement to determine if the value falls below $30,000;
if it does, output a message to alert you (via a print statement)

---
    In this project, you'll create a program that that tells
    you when the value of your Bitcoin falls below $30,000.

    You will need to:
    - Create a function to convert Bitcoin to USD
    - If your Bitcoin falls below $30,000, print a message.

    You can assume that 1 Bitcoin is worth $40,000
